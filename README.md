# Backend - Nice Note Taker

## Project Overview

Nice Note Taker Backend serves as the robust foundation for the note-taking application, employing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Developed using Node.js and Express.js, the backend ensures secure user authentication through JWT and password hashing using bcrypt. PostgreSQL is used for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Key Features

- Secure user authentication with JWT
- Passwords hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security
- Utilizes MVC architecture for efficient data flow

## Architecture/Folder Structure

The backend follows a structured folder organization, including:

- `configs`: Database configuration files
- `controllers`: Logic for authentication and note management
- `middlewares`: Authorization and note-related middlewares
- `routes`: Defines routes for authentication and notes
- `notes.js`: Core logic for note handling

## Getting Started with the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saketh-pothula/Nice-Note--Taker-backend-.git
```

2. Navigate to the Backend directory:

```bash
cd Nice-Note-Taker/Backend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Configure PostgreSQL database in `configs/db.js`
5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend is now ready to handle requests from the frontend. Configure the database and environment variables as needed.
